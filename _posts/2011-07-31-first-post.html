title: Oh hey world, didn't see you there. How've things been?

Just set up an actually somewhat useful website as opposed to the old static HTML one I had before. Still tweaking the colors and layout, but for the most part, I'm happy with it. I look forward to actually posting some content here (yeah right) but in the meantime, it'll just serve as a place to point people to. Might even get me some business cards made up.
