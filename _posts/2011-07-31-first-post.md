title: Oh hey world, didn't see you there. How've things been?

Just set up an actually somewhat useful website as opposed to the old static HTML one I had before. Still tweaking the colors and layout, but for the most part, I'm happy with it. I look forward to actually posting some content here (yeah right) but in the meantime, it'll just serve as a place to point people to. Might even get me some business cards made up. Anyway, just gonna add some filler words here to test out my truncation for posts. Otherwise it looks kind of silly. 75 words shouldn't be too hard to hit with a regular post anyhow.
