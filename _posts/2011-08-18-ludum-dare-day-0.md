title: "Ludum Dare: Day 0 - The Introduction"
---

While eventually I'm going to have to wake up and smell the money, game development has always been my greatest interest. Whenever I'm learning a new programming concept or language, my mind inevitably goes to, "How could I use that in a game?" I'd like to be naive and think that that will always be how I'll learn.

Earlier this week, a post popped up for the [Ludum Dare gamedev competition](http://ludumdare.com/compo/). 48 hours of non-stop game development. I was intrigued, I'd heard the name from earlier competitions, but didn't quite have the skills to enter. After a few side projects of my own though, I feel I could crank a game out in 48 hours. So there you have it, I'm in. Let's get down to the details, shall we?

<h2>The Setup</h2>

As you can see below, there are 2 major components to my setup. You've got my desk:

Which is rocking my newly purchased second monitor, and will shortly be flooded with carbonated beverages and various microwavable meals. And you've got the whiteboard:

All the cool kids have whiteboards, so I needed one too.

<h2>The Tools</h2>

A bad blacksmith blames his tools, so let me get this out of the way. All of the following tools I'll be using are bad:

* Microsoft's XNA 4.0 (C#) or libgdx (Java)
* Paint.net
* [Sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)
* [Drumcircle](http://msm.runhello.com/?p=396)
* Audacity

XNA and libgdx are very similar game libraries that I'm somewhat familiar with. I'd say XNA is way more robust, but libgdx has easy Android porting options and is cross platform. Depending on the complexity of the game I dream up after we find out what the theme is, I'll decide. I'd love to be able to take this 48 hour game and turn it in to a legitimate Android game, but even if I decide to do it in XNA, porting to Windows Phone 7 is an option. On the audio side of things, I've decided on Sfxr and Drumcircle. Sfxr was created by a Ludum Dare-er, for Ludum Dare-ers. It's an awesome tool to crank out vintage style game sounds. Drumcircle is similar, but meant for game loops. I've never used Drumcircle before, but I've tinkered with it a bit and it seems like it'll do the trick. Audacity will simply be used to touch up the audio if I need to.

Over the next few days, I'll try to make a few blog posts, as well as gripe on my newly created [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/wbobeirne) about the development process.
