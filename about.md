I'm William O'Beirne, and one way or another, you stumbled upon this website I whipped up. I'm a programmer, at least I try to be, who writes various games and apps in my free time.


About my work
================

My list of work is pretty small. I have a ton of unpublished works, like any good craftsman, but I've got a few things (including this site) up on my [Github page](https://github.com/wbobeirne), and an [app on the Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=ca.jvsh.textclockpro&feature=search_result). You can find more about that on the projects page.


About the site
================

This site was written in [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), and was sort of scraped together from some various [open source Jekyll pages](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites) with a few touches of my own. You can find my website over [yonder](https://github.com/wbobeirne/wbobeirne.github.com).
