	<h3>Ludum Dare: Day 1 - It Begins</h3>

		<p>The hours leading up to the announcement of the Dare&#8217;s theme, which marks its start, were painful to say the least. I ran through all the possible themes trying to come up with ideas, chatting with the kind folks in the official IRC channel. I tried to pass the time until 10PM EST but man, I just couldn&#8217;t wait.</p>

<p>The time did finally come though, and the theme was voted &#8220;Escape&#8221;, narrowly passing my second-favorite to win, self replication. I wasn&#8217;t really pleased with the outcome, escape is such a vague concept. But at least it gave me plenty of room to work with. I set off to hit up my new pal, the whiteboard, with some ideas.</p>

<p>I eventually settled on an old friend of mine, the penguin with a jetpack. To close family, that will mean a bit more than to the average viewer.</p>

<p>The idea is simple, you play as a penguin who decides to break out of a zoo and take to the skies. Not only are you escaping a zoo, but you&#8217;re escaping the label of &#8220;flightless bird.&#8221; Yeah, I&#8217;m deep like that. The gameplay is simple, you&#8217;re constantly moving upwards trying to dodge X, Y, and Z and picking up junk along the way. I haven&#8217;t ironed everything out, but the idea is to get to some place. The moon maybe? I dont&#8217; know.</p>

<p>I started by simply drawing a penguin sprite that could move from left to right, and a tiled background. From there, things just started to come naturally. I had to lay out an interface and come up with some ideas for objects in the sky:</p>

<p>Then I actually had to implement it. I was able to get a bit done before bed, but when the clock struck 3, I knew I was spent. I&#8217;m aiming for an 18/6/18/6 sleep schedule so that I can get everything done, as well as do a little writing about it, and still finish the game. I wasn&#8217;t sleep much though, I guess I was kind of jazzed, and I was up at 7 with a to do list all ready to go.</p>

<p>As you can see by the crossed out objectives in the picture, I was actually making progress. I&#8217;ve still got a lot to go, but as you can see below, the game is starting to flesh out.</p>

<p>Click for a larger version. The first image was the simple tiled background with the moving penguin, as well as an altometer. The second image shows the generated background. The third one shows the health indicator, re-styled clouds to match the sharp retro look, and randomly appearing obstacles. Not pictured is the menu system which is still pretty homely looking, but functional.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s nap time for me now, I definitely didn&#8217;t get enough sleep. Hopefully, by the next time I post something, there&#8217;ll actually be a game somewhere in there.</p>
