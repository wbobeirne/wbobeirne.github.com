	<h1>Ludum Dare: Day 0 - The Introduction</h1>

	<div id="post-body">
		<p>While eventually I&#8217;m going to have to wake up and smell the money, game development has always been my greatest interest. Whenever I&#8217;m learning a new programming concept or language, my mind inevitably goes to, &#8220;How could I use that in a game?&#8221; I&#8217;d like to be naive and think that that will always be how I&#8217;ll learn.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a post popped up for the <a href='http://ludumdare.com/compo/'>Ludum Dare gamedev competition</a>. 48 hours of non-stop game development. I was intrigued, I&#8217;d heard the name from earlier competitions, but didn&#8217;t quite have the skills to enter. After a few side projects of my own though, I feel I could crank a game out in 48 hours. So there you have it, I&#8217;m in. Let&#8217;s get down to the details, shall we?</p>
<h2>The Setup</h2>
<p>As you can see below, there are 2 major components to my setup. You&#8217;ve got my desk:</p>
<img class='center' src='http://i.imgur.com/B5SNI.jpg' />
<p>Which is rocking my newly purchased second monitor, and will shortly be flooded with carbonated beverages and various microwavable meals. And you&#8217;ve got the whiteboard:</p>

<p>All the cool kids have whiteboards, so I needed one too.</p>
<h2>The Tools</h2>
<p>A bad blacksmith blames his tools, so let me get this out of the way. All of the following tools I&#8217;ll be using are bad:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft&#8217;s XNA 4.0 (C#) or libgdx (Java)</li>

<li>Paint.net</li>

<li><a href='http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html'>Sfxr</a></li>

<li><a href='http://msm.runhello.com/?p=396'>Drumcircle</a></li>

<li>Audacity</li>
</ul>

<p>XNA and libgdx are very similar game libraries that I&#8217;m somewhat familiar with. I&#8217;d say XNA is way more robust, but libgdx has easy Android porting options and is cross platform. Depending on the complexity of the game I dream up after we find out what the theme is, I&#8217;ll decide. I&#8217;d love to be able to take this 48 hour game and turn it in to a legitimate Android game, but even if I decide to do it in XNA, porting to Windows Phone 7 is an option. On the audio side of things, I&#8217;ve decided on Sfxr and Drumcircle. Sfxr was created by a Ludum Dare-er, for Ludum Dare-ers. It&#8217;s an awesome tool to crank out vintage style game sounds. Drumcircle is similar, but meant for game loops. I&#8217;ve never used Drumcircle before, but I&#8217;ve tinkered with it a bit and it seems like it&#8217;ll do the trick. Audacity will simply be used to touch up the audio if I need to.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I&#8217;ll try to make a few blog posts, as well as gripe on my newly created <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/wbobeirne'>Twitter</a> about the development process.</p>
