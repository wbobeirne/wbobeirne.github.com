		<span class="date">August 25, 2011</span>
		
		<p>Well it&#8217;s been a few days since I finished the Ludum Dare, but I still haven&#8217;t written my post-mortem. While I loved the competition to death, by the time I screeched through the finish line, I was absolutly done with it. But let&#8217;s rewind a bit to where we left off on day 1 and a half.</p> <p>So, when I woke up after my well deserved nap of about 4 hours, I started hitting the...

		<p>The hours leading up to the announcement of the Dare&#8217;s theme, which marks its start, were painful to say the least. I ran through all the possible themes trying to come up with ideas, chatting with the kind folks in the official IRC channel. I tried to pass the time until 10PM EST but man, I just couldn&#8217;t wait.</p> <p>The time did finally come though, and the theme was voted &#8220;Escape&#8221;, narrowly passing my second-favorite...

		<span class="date">August 18, 2011</span>
		
		<p>While eventually I&#8217;m going to have to wake up and smell the money, game development has always been my greatest interest. Whenever I&#8217;m learning a new programming concept or language, my mind inevitably goes to, &#8220;How could I use that in a game?&#8221; I&#8217;d like to be naive and think that that will always be how I&#8217;ll learn.</p> <p>Earlier this week, a post popped up for the <a href='http://ludumdare.com/compo/'>Ludum Dare gamedev competition</a>. 48 hours of...

		<p>Just set up an actually somewhat useful website as opposed to the old static HTML one I had before. Still tweaking the colors and layout, but for the most part, I&#8217;m happy with it. I look forward to actually posting some content here (yeah right) but in the meantime, it&#8217;ll just serve as a place to point people to. Might even get me some business cards made up. Anyway, just gonna add some filler words...
