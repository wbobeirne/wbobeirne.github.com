			This is the first release of Twitch Viewer, my Twitch.tv stream viewing app. It's a little rough around the edges, (thus the beta in the title,) but I hope to improve this over time with feedback from you guys. If you've got any questions, requests, or bug reports, don't hesitate to email me at wbobeirne@gmail.com. I promise I'll try to respond.

			Known issues:
			<br/>
			-Search does not produce thumbnails. This is due to the way twitch loads images. I'll keep working on it.
			<br/>
			-Player doesn't fill the screen. I'm working on a better player at the moment, but it all looks the same fullscreened anyway.
			<br/>
			-No way to browse past the first page of results. This one will be coming soon.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Upcoming additions:
			<br/>
			-Favorites list. Right now it's just a button, but I'll add the ability to long press channels and add to favorites.
			<br/>
			-Browse all games. I'll need a better way to organize this than a list view, and Twitch doesn't have box art for every game.
			<br/>
			-Ads. I know this won't be a popular one, but I promise it will be the very last thing I add to the beta. I just wanted full disclosure that they will eventually be coming.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Thanks for checking out my app during the beta. I hope you stick around as everything improves.
