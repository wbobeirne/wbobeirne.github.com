			<h1 id='about_me'>About me</h1>

<p>I&#8217;m William O&#8217;Beirne, and one way or another, you stumbled upon this website I whipped up. I&#8217;m a programmer who writes various games and apps in my free time.</p>

<h1 id='about_my_work'>About my work</h1>

<p>My list of work is pretty small. I have a ton of unpublished works, like any good craftsman, but I&#8217;ve got a few things (including this site) up on my <a href='https://github.com/wbobeirne'>Github page</a>, and an <a href='https://market.android.com/details?id=ca.jvsh.textclockpro&amp;feature=search_result'>app on the Android Market</a>. You can find more about that on the projects page.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently working at Phase2 Technology, building websites with Drupal.</p>

<h1 id='about_the_site'>About the site</h1>

<p>This site was written in <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>, and was sort of scraped together from some various <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites'>open source Jekyll pages</a> with a few touches of my own. You can find my website over <a href='https://github.com/wbobeirne/wbobeirne.github.com'>yonder</a>.</p>

<p>I try to use it as a learning tool for various web technologies, as well as a proof of concept for web design ideas.</p>
